# spaceinvaders

This was meant to be a frontend javascript game, a copy of the legendary space invaders from way back when!

It turned out that there are way more files involved in the node/express server that I built to deploy with Heroku.

Still, it's a wicked game, basically a throwback to oldschool clock-based timings: the view updates on a setTimeout() loop, that will run until a game ending condition is met.

Having built this game, it would be best to start again and from the begining plan to have more aliens, different levels, a score counter, and of course aliens dropping bombs too.
